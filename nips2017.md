* [Deep Learning: Practice and Trends](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8730) / Nando de Freitas · Scott Reed · Oriol Vinyals
  * **Abstract**: Deep Learning has become an essential toolbox which is used in a wide variety of applications, research labs, industry, etc. In this tutorial, we will provide a set of guidelines which will help newcomers to the field understand the most recent and advanced models, their application to diverse data modalities (such as images, videos, waveforms, sequences, graphs,) and to complex tasks (such as learning to learn from a few examples, or generating molecules).

* [Geometric Deep Learning on Graphs and Manifolds](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8735) / Michael Bronstein · Joan Bruna · arthur szlam · Xavier Bresson · Yann LeCun
  * **Abstract**: 	In the past years, deep learning methods have achieved unprecedented performance on a broad range of problems in various fields from computer vision to speech recognition. So far research has mainly focused on developing deep learning methods for Euclidean-structured data, while many important applications have to deal with non-Euclidean structured data, such as graphs and manifolds. Such geometric data are becoming increasingly important in computer graphics and 3D vision, sensor networks, drug design, biomedicine, recommendation systems, and web applications. The adoption of deep learning in these fields has been lagging behind until recently, primarily since the non-Euclidean nature of objects dealt with makes the very definition of basic operations used in deep networks rather elusive.
  
	The purpose of the proposed tutorial is to introduce the emerging field of geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds, overview existing solutions and applications for this class of problems, as well as key difficulties and future research directions.
