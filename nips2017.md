* [Deep Learning: Practice and Trends](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2017/Schedule?showEvent=8730) / Nando de Freitas · Scott Reed · Oriol Vinyals
  * **Abstract**: Deep Learning has become an essential toolbox which is used in a wide variety of applications, research labs, industry, etc. In this tutorial, we will provide a set of guidelines which will help newcomers to the field understand the most recent and advanced models, their application to diverse data modalities (such as images, videos, waveforms, sequences, graphs,) and to complex tasks (such as learning to learn from a few examples, or generating molecules).
